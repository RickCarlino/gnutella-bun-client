        <h1>Glossary</h1>

        <p>
          This glossary derives from the old
          <a href="/manual/">Online Manual</a>. More terms are being included.
          Some definitions derive from the
          <a
            href="http://rfc-gnutella.sourceforge.net/src/rfc-0_6-draft.html"
            target="_blank"

        <div class="glossary_capital">B</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">
          Bandwidth <em>hint</em> for GUESS querying
        </div>

        <p>
          This is termes <em>bandwidth hint</em> because GUESS uses UDP and
          cannot fraction large messages to emit just a few bytes. Therefore,
          the bandwidth is just a hint because it can be exceeded if a set of
          queries need to be made and their total amount exceeds the allocated
          bandwidth. Lower values means we can send less queries, and therefore
          the overall querying is slowed down (meaning the total querying will
          take longer) because each query is sent to <em>one</em> GUESS
          ultrapeer.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">Bootstrap</div>

        <p>
          The process of joining the Gnutella network by discovering peers is
          called bootstrapping. More informations
          <a href="?page=bootstrap">here</a>.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">Bucket (of a routing table)</div>

        <p>
          A <em>bucket</em> is a portion of the node ID space covered by the
          routing table. Each bucket can only hold K nodes, currently eight,
          before becoming &quot;full&quot;. When a bucket is full of known good
          nodes, no more nodes may be added unless our own node ID falls within
          the range of the bucket. In that case, the bucket is replaced by two
          new buckets each with half the range of the old bucket and the nodes
          from the old bucket are distributed among the two new ones. This is
          called &quot;bucket SPLIT&quot;. The opposite operation involving
          buckets is called MERGE.<br />
          Every node maintains a routing table of known good nodes. The nodes in
          the routing table are used as starting points for queries in the DHT.
          Nodes from the routing table are returned in response to queries from
          other nodes. It is important that each node's routing table must
          contain only known good nodes. A good node is a node has responded to
          one of our queries within the last 15 minutes. A node is also good if
          it has ever responded to one of our queries and has sent us a query
          within the last 15 minutes. After 15 minutes of inactivity, a node
          becomes questionable. Nodes become bad when they fail to respond to
          multiple queries in a row. Nodes that we know are good are given
          priority over nodes with unknown status.<br />

          The above informations have been readapted from
          <a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html" target="_blank"

        <div class="glossary_term">Bye</div>

        <p>
          This is an optional message used to inform the remote host that the
          connection is being closed and the reason for doing so.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">D</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">Descriptor</div>

        <p>
          The entity in which information is transmitted over the network. Same
          as <em>message</em>.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">DHT</div>

        <p>
          Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is a <em>hash table</em> distributed
          among Gnutella network nodes. Gtk-Gnutella uses an implementation of
          Kademlia for its DHT. Kademlia is also used for other p2p networks
          (such as eDonkey) but storing different keys and values, therere
          preventing inter-operability between DHT of different p2p networks. In
          Gnutella, DHT is used for exact lookups, alternate locations,
          push-proxies, etc. but not for keywords search. Operations such as
          <em>lookup, publish, store, etc.</em> are typically performed in a DHT
          whose nodes can be either active or passive.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">E</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">EAR</div>

        <p>
          <em>EAR</em> stands for &quot;Extra Acknowledgement Request&quot;.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">F</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">Flow Control (FC) mode</div>

        <p>
          Servents pile outgoing packets in a queue where they are broadcasted
          in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) mode. If outgoing bandwidth is small
          and many packets need to be broadcasted, the queue gets overloaded and
          the servent enters in <em>Flow Control (FC) mode</em>. While in FC
          mode all incoming queries on the connection are dropped. Of course
          servents should avoid entering FC mode by being granted more bandwidth
          or reducing the number of connected nodes.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">Flooding</div>

        <p>
          <em>Flooding</em> is a simple but inefficient P2P routing algorithm
          which sends messages to all the connected nodes in order to reach
          destination. The flooding algorithm have been replaced by the more
          efficient <em>GUESS</em> algorithm.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">G</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">G2 Hub</div>

        <p>
          G2 Hubs in Gnutella2 network are equivalent to Ultrapeers in
          GnutellaNet. GTK-Gnutella usually connects to 2 G2 Hubs behaving as a
          leaf node on Gnutella2 network.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">GGEP</div>

        <p>
          Gnutella Generic Extension Protocol (GGEP) includes new functions
          added to the original Gnutella 0.4 protocol: more informations
          <a
            href="http://rfc-gnutella.sourceforge.net/src/GnutellaGenericExtensionProtocol.0.51.html"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">GIV</div>

        <p>
          <em>GIV</em> is the message sent by the servent that is going to send
          a file in response to a request.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">GnutellaNet</div>

        <p>
          The GnutellaNet (or &quot;Gnutella&quot; in short) is an
          <em>overlay</em> network. This means it is a network that sits on top
          of the normal internet. GnutellaNet is <em>unstructured</em>. This
          just means that no particular computer or group of computers controls
          GnutellaNet; it is probably more democratic than most governments.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the GnutellaNet is an overlay network, it doesn't have to pay
          attention to geography. It is likely that you will connect to
          computers in other countries. Things might be faster if this was not
          the case. However, they may also be more resilient in the current
          form.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">
          GUESS (Gnutella UDP Extension for Scalable Searches)
        </div>

        <p>
          As opposed to <em>flooding</em> algorithm, with GUESS routing nodes
          are queried one at a time. Each node must keep a cache of known and
          trusted peers able to accept queries and the nodes are picked up
          randomly. This routing method is considered more efficient and safe
          compared to flooding.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">GUID (Global Unique IDentifier)</div>

        <p>
          This is a 16-byte long value made of random bytes, whose purpose it is
          to identify servents and messages. This identification is not a
          signature, just a way to identify network entities in a unique manner.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">H</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">HSEP</div>

        <p>
          The Horizon Size Estimation Protocol (HSEP) refers to the estimation
          of the number of reachable resources within the Gnutella network, e.g.
          the number of reachable Gnutella nodes, shared files and shared
          kibibytes. More informations
          <a href="http://www.schuerger.com/gnutella/hsep.html" target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">L</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">Leaf node</div>

        <p>
          A leaf is the basic connection to the GnutellaNet. A leaf typically
          connects to three or four ultrapeers. The ultrapeers route searches
          and keep their leaves connected to the GnutellaNet.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">M</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">Message</div>

        <p>
          <em>Messages</em> are the entity in which information is transmitted
          over the network. Synonyms are <em>packet</em> and
          <em>descriptor</em>.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">MUID (Messages Unique IDentifier)</div>

        <p>A <em>GUID</em> for network messages.</p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">P</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">PARQ (Passive/Active Remote Queuing)</div>
        <p>
          When a servent asks for a file hosted by a servent having no free
          upload slots, the request enters a remote queue on the hosting sevent.
          This remote queue is handled by <em>PARQ</em>.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">Ping</div>

        <p>
          A <em>Ping</em> is a message sent by a servent trying to actively
          discover hosts on the network. A servent receiving a Ping message is
          expected to respond with one or more Pong messages.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">Pong</div>

        <p>
          A <em>Pong</em> is the response message to a Ping. It includes the
          address of a connected Gnutella servent, the listening port of that
          servent, and information regarding the amount of data it is making
          available to the network.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">Push</div>

        <p>
          This is a mechanism that allows a firewalled servent to contribute
          file-based data to the network. For example a servent may send a Push
          message if it receives a QueryHit message from a servent that doesn't
          support incoming connections. This might occur when the servent
          sending the QueryHit message is behind a firewall.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">Push-proxy</div>

        <p>
          A <em>push-proxy</em> is a relaying node. If an ultrapeer is connected
          to the firewalled leaf, in order to send a <em>push</em>
          to that firewalled leaf, a servent can send an UDP message to the
          ultrapeer who will then relay it to the leaf. So the ultrapeer acts as
          the push-proxy: it is the relaying target to reach the leaf.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">Q</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">QRP</div>

        <p>
          Query Routing Protocol (QRP) is a scheme for avoiding broadcast
          queries on the Gnutella network. In this scheme, hosts create query
          route tables by hashing file keywords and regularly exchange them with
          their neighbors. Standard compression techniques minimize the cost of
          exchanging tables. This scheme can dramatically reduce Gnutella's
          bandwidth requirements improving scalability and leaving more
          bandwidth for files exchange.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">Query</div>

        <p>
          Sending a <em>Query</em> is the primary mechanism for searching the
          distributed network. A servent receiving a Query message will respond
          with a QueryHit if a match is found against its local data set.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">QueryHit</div>

        <p>
          A <em>QueryHit</em> is the response to a Query. This message provides
          the recipient with enough information to acquire the data matching the
          corresponding Query.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">R</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">RUDP</div>

        <p>
          The Reliable UDP (RUDP) protocol provides NAT-to-NAT transfers,
          sometimes called Firewall-to-Firewall or &quot;hole-punching&quot;, in
          those cases where port-forwarding is not or cannot be done by the
          user.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">RX</div>

        <p>
          RX stands for <em>Reception</em>, opposite of <em>Transmission</em>.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">S</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">search literals</div>

        <p>
          Double and single quotes can be used so that an entire search term
          will be matched instead of individual words. Quoting maybe necessary
          if you wish to search for a phrase with special characters such as the
          plus and minus signs (see &quot;search requireds&quot;).
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">search prefixes</div>

        <ol>
          <li>
            browse: List shared files on the specified host. The format is
            "browse:<em>ip_address:port</em>". Many portions of the GUI have a
            menu option, available from a right click, that will browser the
            specified computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            http: Download the specified web page. This could be a zip file, a
            movie, large JPEG, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            local: Search results from the local host. Ie, your computer. A
            regular expression may follow to filter the results. For example,
            "local:manual" will show all files you share with manual in the file
            name.
          </li>
          <li>magnet: Search and download the magnet target.</li>
          <li>
            push: The format of this search is
            "push:<em>guid:ip_address:port/path_to_file</em>". The
            <em>guid</em> is the Gnutella ID of the computer that has the file
            of interest. The <em>ip:port</em> is the push proxy that the
            <em>guid</em> is connected to. Typically this would be an ultrapeer
            that will allow a proxy download. The <em>guid</em> is a 32
            hexadecimal characters.
          </li>
          <li>
            sha1: A base64 SHA value to search for. It is not automatically
            downloaded.
          </li>
          <li>
            urn: Similar to a sha1 search, but the hash value is specified. Ie,
            urn:sha1:<em>hash value</em>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="glossary_term">search requireds</div>

        <p>
          Mini filters are created with the '+' and '-' signs. The plus sign
          requires that a word is part of the results. The minus sign doesn't
          display any results with the given phrase. The plus and minus signs
          can be used to select ambigious terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose you wish to find information about apples. You might use a
          search like <em>apples -computers</em>. You may get even more relevant
          results by using <em>apples +fruit</em>.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">Servent</div>

        <p>
          &quot;Servent&quot; word derives from the fusion of server+client. A
          node in a P2P network is called <em>servent</em> because of the dual
          nature of both server and client.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">SOAP</div>

        <p>
          Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a lightweight XML-based
          protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized, distributed
          environment like P2P networks. More informations

        <div class="glossary_term">THEX</div>

        <p>
          The Tree Hash EXchange (THEX) format is used for exchanging Merkle
          Hash Trees built up from the subrange hashes of discrete digital
          files. More informations

          >.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">Time-To-Live (TTL)</div>

        <p>
          TTL is the number of times a message will be forwarded by Gnutella
          servents before it is removed from the network. Each servent will
          decrement the TTL value before passing it on to another servent. When
          the TTL value reaches 0, the message will no longer be forwarded to
          avoid eccessive network traffic.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_term">TX</div>

        <p>TX stands for <em>Transmission</em>.</p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">U</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">Ultrapeer (UP)</div>

        <p>
          An ultrapeer is well connected to the GnutellaNet. As ultrapeers must
          have many connections and route search queries, they require more
          resources than a leaf node. Ultrapeers will typically be connected to
          30+ other ultrapeers and connected to 70+ leaf nodes.
        </p>

        <div class="glossary_capital">V</div>

        <div class="glossary_term">Vendor Code</div>

        <p>
          The Vendor Code is a conventional 4-letter code used in Query Hits to
          identify the software running the node that generated the hit. For
          gtk-gnutella the Vendor Code is <em>GTKG</em>.
